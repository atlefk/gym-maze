# Maze environment for GYM

## Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/UIA-CAIR/gym-maze.git
```

## Basic Usage
```python
import gym
import gym_maze # This is required in order to load gym-maze
import os

if __name__ == '__main__':
    

    # Reset environment
    env = gym.make("maze-arr-11x11-full-deterministic-v0")
    s = env.reset()

    # Set terminal state to false
    terminal = False

    while not terminal:
        # Draw environment on screen
        env.render()  # For image you MUST call this

        # Draw action from distribution
        a = env.action_space.sample()

        # Perform action in environment
        s1, r, t, _ = env.step(a)
        terminal = t

        s = s1
```

## Available Environments
There are several configurations available for gym-maze.

### Naming Convention
[name]-[representation]-[size_w]x[size_h]-[type]-v0

**name** - Name of the environment

**representation** - How the state is represented to the user. 'Img' delivers a **84x84x3** state while 'Arr' delivers size of the game board (9x9 game delivers  9x9 state)

**size_w** - Indicates width of game board

**size_h** - Indicates height of game board

**type** - Indicates weither RNG is deterministic (non-random) or stochastic (random). There is also a full-random mode that also remove randomness from spawn location
